                <p>
                    A child who likes to watch Crayon Shin-chan.
                    A student who wants to study in Japan.
                    A people who wants to try something new but is a little scared
                    This probably refers to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am good at assembling computers, which is also my hobby. 
                    During college, I assembled four computers, not only my own but also those of my classmates.
                    Of course, I also collect hardware such as old CPUs. 
                    People like us are also called "ÂûÉÂúæ‰Ω¨(junk guys)".
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also like anime, games, and TV series. 
                    If it's anime, it must be Japanese anime.
                    Let's see other people's recommendations for TV series.
                    As for games, I like both competitive and single-player games, covering a wide range.
                    I can also play Go and Chinese chess. 
                    I am good at 9*9 and 13*13 Go. I have reached the 7th dan level in 9*9 on Yehu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a food lover and I love desserts, 
                    because they can help me quickly replenish sugar and recharge my brain.
                    I also like cooking. 
                    I am good at Chinese, Japanese, and Korean food. 
                    Of course, I also know a little bit of Western food. 
                    I have my own unique recipes for pork ribs, oden, and Korean hot pot.
                    In short, cooking is a matter of unlimited imagination. 
                    Because there is no absolute deliciousness in food, 
                    only deliciousness that suits your taste.
