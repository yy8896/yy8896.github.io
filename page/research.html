                <h3>Evolutionary Computation</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently studying evolutionary computation. 
                    This is mainly because I often use genetic algorithms to solve constrained optimization problems in data modeling competitions. 
                    I really want to join Professor Claus Aranha's research group.
                    Because he is so humorous and the content of his homepage is very attractive to me. 
                    I think it must be a very cool thing to join them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently studying the decomposition and automatic combination of meta-heuristic algorithm components. 
                    I hope to combine new algorithms for a class of problems through offline training.
                    I hope to try various methods such as evolutionary computing, machine learning, etc. for this combined training.
                    At the same time, I plan to make it my undergraduate graduation project.

                <h3>Imbalance Data and Data Synthesis</h3>
                <p>
                    This period of research lasted about a year and a half, 
                    from my sophomore year to my junior year. 
                    This was my first time to engage in academic research.
                    I studied and researched the application of generative networks to structured data. 
                    I mastered various generative networks such as GANs, diffusion models.

                    During this period of research, 
                    although the paper was not published for some reasons, I gained a lot. 
                    I am very grateful for this experience and Professor Zheng Ming.
